      <h2>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single
        source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Time Complexity:</b> O(V^2) for adjacency matrix representation, O((V
        + E)logV) for adjacency list representation using priority queue.

          Mark the source node with a current distance of 0 and the rest with
          infinity.

          Set the non-visited node with the smallest current distance as the
          current node.

        <li>
          For each neighbor, N of the current node adds the current distance of
          the adjacent node with the weight of the edge connecting 0->1. If it
          is smaller than the current distance of Node, set it as the new
          current distance of N.
        </li>
        <li>Mark the current node 1 as visited.</li>

      <h2>Floyd Warshall Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        The Floyd Warshall algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between
        all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge
        weights.
      </p>
      <p><b>Time Complexity: </b> O(V^3).</p>

    <div class="algo">
      <h3>Algorithm for Floyd Warshall Algorithm:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initialize the solution matrix same as the input graph matrix as a
          first step.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then update the solution matrix by considering all vertices as an
          intermediate vertex.
        </li>
        <li>
          The idea is to pick all vertices one by one and updates all shortest
          paths which include the picked vertex as an intermediate vertex in the
          shortest path.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we pick vertex number k as an intermediate vertex, we already
          have considered vertices {0, 1, 2, .. k-1} as intermediate vertices.
        </li>
        <li>
          GFor every pair (i, j) of the source and destination vertices
          respectively, there are two possible cases.
          <ul>
            <li>
              k is not an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We
              keep the value of dist[i][j] as it is.
            </li>
            <li>
              k is an intermediate vertex in shortest path from i to j. We
              update the value of
              <b>
                dist[i][j] as dist[i][k] + dist[k][j], if dist[i][j] >

      <h2>A* Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
        The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in
        a graph. It uses heuristics to improve the efficiency of the search.
      </p>
      <p>
